# R for the uninitiated

This is the repository for the R course for the MolMed 2023.


This course will focus on 2 parts:

##### PART 1
* R package installation and debugging
* understand critical programming language concepts
* ggplot2 and basic statistics

##### PART 2
* advance packages and Shiny
* learning resources and beyond

We will focus allot on recent GUIs and helper packages that make R more “click click” and less “type type”.

Nonetheless the morning will be devoted to the basics so you will be able to modify scripts to that one plot exactly the way you want to make it.
