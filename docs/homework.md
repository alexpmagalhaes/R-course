### A couple of basics with R

1. In R everything is an **object** and is stored in the environment
2. We can **create objects** by using **"<-"**
3. **"="** is redundant with **"<-"** but we use equal sign for formulas
4. Objects have different **classes**, be aware of the requisition of data classes in the packages
5. **Transformations** aka functions can be applied to lists of variables aka **vectors**. This vectors are created with **"c()"** and the variables are separated with **","**
6. If you give a name to an object out can check the value aka **printing** by typing the name of the object
7. R will give you errors, study these and use google. If you had this problem someone in the internet already had it.
8. Help can be requested in R by typing the **"?""** and the name of the function.
Also packages have examples and help file that are called **vignettes**

##### In R studio you have access to interactive warnings, auto-complete, scripting and notebook functions that make R really easy to use!

One important point is to understand the difference between **console**, **script** and **notebook**.

### Let s create a Project
1. First we want to create a project folder **File** -> **New Project...**

2. On the *console* I want you to:
  1. Calculate 5+7-1
  2. Store that result to an object
  3. Store each individual variable as an object (call them **x**, **y** and **z**)
  4. Define a function to sum **x** and **y** and subtract **z**
  5. **Print** that function
  6. Use other arithmetic functions with that object like  **log2()**, **log10()**, **exp()**, **sqrt()**

3. I want you to create a new *R Script*

    If  you want to comment on a line of code you can use **#** and then write your notes.
      R will ignore everything after the **#**
  1. Copy the console code that you typed into the scrip!
  2. Use <kbd>&#8984;</kbd> or <kbd>Control</kbd> and <kbd>Enter &#x23ce;</kbd> to run a line of code aka **chunk**
  3. You should get the same result.
  4. Make a **vector** containing
  * 4 twos
  * 6 threes
  * 8 fours
  * 8 fives
  * 4 sevens
  * 4 eights
  * 2 nines
  5. Get some information on the object like **_"length"_**, **_"class"_** , **_"max"_**and the **_"mean"_** of the values.
  6. Plot an **_hist_**ogram of the object.
  7. Add 1 to that vector
  8. Print that new vector


If everything went smooth you just wrote your first lines in R!
#### Congratulations!!!!

##### We will save the notebook for the course!

You can [download](https://alexpmagalhaes.github.io/SFB924-R-course/Materials/Scripts/Homework.R) the r script for reference!
